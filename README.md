# CIS569-Project2
### TO-DO/FIXES:
####-Links show up behind the bounding box
#####- make them show in front of bounding boxes and behind document and description boxes
####-When the bounding box is dragged the docs don't get dragged with it
#####- fix this to drag all elements in a cluster at once
####-There is currently no functionality to open all docs in a cluster at once yet 
#####- add this functionality
####-The description boxes can open and be outside the boundary 
#####- set rule if they open outside to open inside instaed
####-There is no limitations on the movement of any boxes 
#####- change to only allow movement within clusters
