# CIS569-Project2
### TO-DO/FIXES:
#### -Links show up behind the bounding box
##### ----- make them show in front of bounding boxes and behind document and description boxes
#### -There is currently no functionality to open all docs in a cluster at once yet 
##### ----- add this functionality
#### -The description boxes can open and be outside the boundary 
##### ----- set rule if they open outside to open inside instead
##### ----- currently can be dragged slightly outside. DO WE MAKE THIS A TIGHTER BOUNDARY?
##### ----- make them open on top of the docs
